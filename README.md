# Current Bugs 
None Currently waiting for testing 

# Solved Bugs
- Deleting rules sometimes results in errors 
> Bug is sloved, user should just input the rule number in reverse from greater to smaller.

# To Do 
- Add a feature to enable/disable logging(built in UFW feature)
- The current Rules managment is a bit limited. We can include the some advanced features such as edit rules to manage the Direction, Policy, Interfaces, Log?(built in one), Protocol, IP, and Port.
- Sepereate the Basic rule Managment menu from the advanced one. 
- Prompt a message of what will happen by selecting the default setup before initializing it
- Add only Root (UID 0) Permissons
- VPN?
- Add an about section for info and showing the license
